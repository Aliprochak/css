    <p class="body1">I would like to talk about web development.Web development governs
         all the code that makes a website tick. It can be split into two categories—front-end 
         and back-end. The front-end or client-side of an application is the code responsible
         for determining how the website will actually display the designs mocked up by a designer.
         The back-end or server-side of an application is responsible for managing data within
         the database and serving that data to the front-end to be displayed. As you may have guessed, 
         it’s the front-end developer’s job that tends to share the most overlap with the web designer.
    </p>
    <p class="body2">
        <u> <b> Front-end web developers </b> </u> don’t usually create mock-ups, select typography, or pick 
        color palettes—these are usually provided by the designer. It’s the developer’s job
        to bring those mock-ups to life. That said, understanding what the designer wants 
        requires some knowledge of best practices in UI/UX design so that the developer is 
        able to choose the right technology to deliver the desired look and feel and experience 
        in the final product.
